              The development team designed Awakening with the intention of giving the franchise a proper farewell if they were ultimately unsuccessful in selling enough units. They explored many different concepts, including placing the story in a modern-day setting and even placing the story on Mars. Ultimately, the team decided that keeping the story in its medieval roots would be the best route to take. To further celebrate the series, the team pulled various tactics and features from numerous previous titles such as Skills, Promotion Branching, and Supports. Along with the story, the team decided to focus on the individual units themselves, fleshing out their characters with quirkier personalities and emphasized the formation of bonds between units, ultimately factoring in the feature of having children characters. The game was also developed early on with an international release in mind.
